Please check the assignment handout for these details for the exact due date and whether you can work in groups or not. DO NOT EMAIL YOUR ASSIGNMENTS TO US.

		<h3>Re Marking</h3>
			<p>If a piece of work has been mis-marked or if you believe the rubric used to evaluate the work is not appropriate, you may request a re-mark. For a re-mark to succeed, you must clearly and concisely express what you believe was mis-marked or unfairly marked. To request a re-mark, set up an appointment with the instructor and the TA that has marked your assignment/exam. PLEASE DO NOT USE THE DISCUSSION BOARD REQUESTING FOR REMARKS. Be prepared for the entire work to be re-evaluated and for the mark to be adjusted up or down after the re-evaluation. Remark request MUST be made in 5 regular days time after the mark is made available. No remark request will be accepted after 5 regular days.</p>
