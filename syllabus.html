			<p>There are three assignments. You may be asked to work in pairs in some of these assignments. Please check the assignment handout for these details for the exact due date and whether you can work in groups or not. DO NOT EMAIL YOUR ASSIGNMENTS TO US. We will use MARKUS for the submission of all assignments. ALL AS- SIGNMENTS WILL MARKED ON UTSC LAB MACHINES. IT IS IMPORTANT BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR ASSIGNMENT, TO MAKE SURE THAT IT COMPILES AND EXECUTES ON THE UTSC LAB MACHINES.

This means no question about the assignment will be answered by instructor or the TA whether it is asked on the bulletin board, by email or in person.</p>
			<h3>Re Marking</h3>
			<p>If a piece of work has been mis-marked or if you believe the rubric used to evaluate the work is not appropriate, you may request a re-mark. For a re-mark to succeed, you must clearly and concisely express what you believe was mis-marked or unfairly marked. To request a re-mark, set up an appointment with the instructor and the TA that has marked your assignment/exam. PLEASE DO NOT USE THE DISCUSSION BOARD REQUESTING FOR REMARKS. Be prepared for the entire work to be re-evaluated and for the mark to be adjusted up or down after the re-evaluation. Remark request MUST be made in 5 regular days time after the mark is made available. No remark request will be accepted after 5 regular days.</p>
			<h3>Labs</h3>
			<p>During Labs, attendance is mandatory and on some occasions the TA will take attendance and assign you small in lab exercises. Labs are a great way for you to get some hands-on practice at programming.</p>
			<h3>Final Exam</h3>
			<p>There is a 3hrs final exam. The final exam is comprehensive, and you must obtain a mark of at least 40% to pass the course; otherwise, a grade of no higher than 47% will be assigned.</p>
			<h3>Late Policy</h3>
			<p>There are no grace days; all due dates are firm. In case of illness, please have a doctor complete an official U of T medical certificate. For other emergencies, be prepared for us to request some kind of documentation.
